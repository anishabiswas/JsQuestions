      Question: The Coffee Machine: In your coffee shop application, you need to
      simulate the process of brewing coffee asynchronously. Write an async
      function named brewCoffee that takes the type of coffee and returns a
      promise. The promise should resolve with a message indicating that the
      coffee is ready after a random delay.
