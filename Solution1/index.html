      Question1: The Magical Sorting Hat: Imagine you are creating a magical
      sorting hat for a wizard school. Implement a JavaScript function that
      takes an array of student names and assigns them to one of the four houses
      (Gryffindor (length less than 6), Hufflepuff(length less than 8),
      Ravenclaw(length less than 12), or Slytherin(length greater than or equal
      to 12)) based on the length of their names.
